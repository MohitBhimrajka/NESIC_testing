# NEW Instruction Block for Document Handling
DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTION = textwrap.dedent("""\
    *   **CRITICAL: Analysis of Provided Documents (PDFs, PPTXs, etc.):**
        *   **Priority Source:** You **WILL BE PROVIDED** with relevant documents (e.g., internal presentations, past proposals, meeting notes, org charts). Treat these documents as a **PRIMARY and often MORE CURRENT/DETAILED source of context** than general web search results, especially regarding:
            *   Specific ongoing projects, initiatives, and timelines.
            *   Internal challenges, pain points, and stated needs.
            *   Detailed organizational structure, key personnel, and decision-making processes.
            *   Relationship history or past engagements between {company_name} and {context_company_name} (if mentioned).
            *   Specific figures, targets, or plans not yet publicly released.
        *   **Mandatory Integration:** Your analysis and the resulting Account Strategy **MUST** deeply integrate insights extracted directly from these provided documents. Do not rely solely on web grounding when relevant document information is available.
        *   **Information Extraction:** Diligently extract information from all parts of the documents:
            *   **Text:** Key strategies, statements, goals, challenges, personnel names/roles.
            *   **Tables:** Financial data, project timelines, KPI targets, organizational lists. Extract relevant data accurately.
            *   **Charts/Graphs:** Summarize the key trends, data points, or conclusions presented visually. Note the existence and location (e.g., "Chart on slide 15 shows X trend [DOC1, Slide 15]"). Do not attempt to recreate charts.
            *   **Images/Diagrams:** Interpret information conveyed (e.g., Org charts, process flows, infrastructure diagrams). Describe the key takeaways and note the location (e.g., "Org chart on p.3 indicates... [DOC2, p.3]").
        *   **Document Citation (MANDATORY & DISTINCT):**
            *   Cite information extracted *directly* from provided documents using the format `[DOCX, reference]`, where 'X' is the document number (if multiple are provided, assume DOC1 if only one) and 'reference' is the specific page number, slide number, section header, or figure/table identifier (e.g., `[DOC1, p.5]`, `[DOC2, Slide 10]`, `[DOC1, Section 3.1]`).
            *   This `[DOCX]` citation is **distinct** from the `[SSX]` citation used for web grounding URLs. Use the appropriate citation type based on the information's origin.
        *   **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicting information exists between provided documents and web grounding results:
            *   Prioritize the **latest official provided document** for internal strategy, plans, and organizational details specific to {company_name}. Cite as `[DOCX]`.
            *   Prioritize the **latest verifiable public web grounding source** (`[SSX]`) for publicly stated facts (e.g., official revenue figures, CEO name).
            *   If a significant conflict exists that impacts the strategy, briefly note it in the analysis (e.g., "Document [DOC1, p. 8] outlines Plan A, while recent press release [SS3] mentions Plan B adjustment.").
        *   **Multi-lingual Documents:** Be prepared to process documents in Japanese or English. Extract relevant information regardless of source language and present the final analysis in the target output language: **{language}**.
        *   **Silent Omission:** If specific information requested cannot be verified *either* through web grounding (`[SSX]`) *or* within the provided documents (`[DOCX]`) after exhaustive review, omit it silently per the standard handling instructions.

ADDITIONAL_REFINED_INSTRUCTIONS = textwrap.dedent("""\
    **Additional Refined Instructions for Zero Hallucination, Perfect Markdown, and Strict Single-Entity Coverage:**

    *   **Mandatory Self-Check Before Final Output:**
        - Before producing the final answer, confirm:
            1. All requested sections are fully included with correct headings.
            2. All factual statements have inline citations [SSX] pointing to valid Vertex AI URLs in the final Sources list.
            3. Only the permitted Vertex AI grounding URLs are used—no external or fabricated links.
            4. Markdown headings and tables follow the specified format (##, ###, consistent columns, **strict pipe alignment**). Ensure data within tables is accurate against the source.
            5. A single "Sources" section is present, properly labeled, and each source is on its own line.
            6. Inline citations appear before punctuation where feasible.
            7. No data or sources are invented. If information is omitted due to lack of verifiable grounding after exhaustive search, this is done silently without comment.
            8.  **Strict Single-Entity Focus:** Strictly reference only the **exact** company named: **'{company_name}'** (with identifiers like Ticker: '{ticker}', Industry: '{industry}' if provided). **Crucially verify** you are NOT including data from similarly named but unrelated entities (e.g., if the target is 'Marvell Technology, Inc.', absolutely DO NOT include 'Marvel Entertainment' or data related to comics/movies). Confirm if data relates to the parent/consolidated entity or a specific subsidiary, and report accordingly based ONLY on the source [SSX].
            9. Verify recency of all primary sources used (AR, MTP, website data, etc.).
            10. Confirm key financial figures and table data points against cited sources. **Verify specifically that all financial data has valid [SSX] citations linked to provided grounding URLs.**
            11. Ensure lists (KPIs, Officers, Subsidiaries) are complete based on source availability.
            12. Confirm analytical depth provided where requested (explaining 'why' and drivers).

    *   **Exactness of Table Columns:**
        - Each row in any table **MUST** have the exact same number of columns as the header row, delimited by pipes (`|`).
        - Use exactly one pipe (`|`) at the beginning and end of each row.
        - Ensure header separator lines (`|---|---|`) match the number of columns precisely.
        - If data for a specific cell is missing *in the source* after exhaustive search, use a simple hyphen (-) as a placeholder *only if necessary* to maintain table structure and alignment. Do not add explanatory text.
        - Always include an inline citation [SSX] if referencing factual numbers within a table cell or in a note below the table referencing the table's data. Verify the cited data matches the source.

    *   **Quotes with Inline Citations:**
        - Any verbatim quote must include:
            1. The speaker's name and date or document reference in parentheses.
            2. An inline citation [SSX] immediately following.
        - This ensures clarity on who said it, when they said it, and the exact source.

    *   **Exactness of Hyperlinks in Sources:**
        - The final "Sources" section must use the format "* [Supervity Source X](Full_Vertex_AI_Grounding_URL) - Brief annotation [SSX]."
        - Number sources sequentially without skipping.
        - Provide no additional domain expansions or transformations beyond what is given.
        - Do not summarize entire documents—only note which facts the source supports.

    *   **Do Not Summarize Sources:**
        - In each source annotation, reference only the specific claim(s) the link supports, not a broad summary.

    *   **High-Priority Checklist (Must Not Be Violated):**
        1. No fabrication: Silently omit rather than invent ungrounded data after exhaustive search.
        2. Adhere strictly to the specified Markdown formats (headings, lists, **perfect tables**).
        3. Use inline citations [SSX] matching final sources exactly.
        4. Provide only one "Sources" section at the end.
        5. Do not use any URLs outside "vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/..." pattern if not explicitly provided.
        6.  **Enforce Single-Entity Coverage (CRITICAL):** If '{company_name}' is the focus, DO NOT include other similarly named but unrelated entities. Verify target entity identity throughout.
        7. Complete an internal self-check (see above) to ensure compliance with all instructions before concluding.

FINAL_SOURCE_LIST_INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE = textwrap.dedent("""\
    **Final Source List Requirements:**

    Conclude the *entire* research output, following the 'General Discussion' paragraph, with a clearly marked section titled "**Sources**". This section is critical for verifying the information grounding process AND for document generation.

    **1. Content - MANDATORY URL Type & Source Integrity:**
    *   **Exclusive Source Type:** This list **MUST** contain *only* the specific grounding redirect URLs provided directly by the **Vertex AI Search system** *for this specific query*. These URLs represent the direct grounding evidence used.
    *   **URL Pattern:** These URLs typically follow the pattern: `https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/...`. **Only URLs matching this exact pattern are permitted.**
    *   **Strict Filtering:** Absolutely **DO NOT** include any other type of URL (direct website links, news, PDFs found elsewhere, etc.).
    *   # NEW: Explicitly exclude DOCX citations from this list
        **Document citations (`[DOCX, reference]`) MUST NOT be included in this final "Sources" list.** Those citations are handled inline only, referencing the provided documents directly. This list is exclusively for the `[SSX]` web grounding URLs.
    *   **CRITICAL - No Hallucination:** **Under NO circumstances should you invent, fabricate, infer, or reuse `vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/...` URLs** from previous queries or general knowledge if they were not explicitly provided as grounding results *for this query*. If a fact is identified but lacks a corresponding provided grounding URL after exhaustive search, it must be silently omitted from the report body AND no source should be listed for it.
    *   **Purpose:** This list verifies the specific web grounding data provided by Vertex AI Search for this request—not external knowledge, other URLs, or provided documents.

    **2. Formatting and Annotation (CRITICAL FOR PARSING):**
    *   **Source Line Format:** Present each source on a completely new line. Each line **MUST** start with a Markdown list indicator (`* ` or `- `) followed by the hyperlink in Markdown format and then its annotation.
    *   **REQUIRED Format:**
        * [Supervity Source X](Full_Vertex_AI_Grounding_URL) - Annotation explaining exactly what information is supported (e.g., supports CEO details and FY2023 revenue [SSX]).
    *   **Sequential Labeling:** The visible hyperlink text **MUST** be labeled sequentially "Supervity Source 1", "Supervity Source 2", etc. Do not skip numbers.
    *   **Annotation Requirement:** The annotation MUST be:
        * Included immediately after the hyperlink on the same line, separated by " - ".
        * Brief and specific, explaining exactly which piece(s) of information in the main body (and referenced with inline citation [SSX]) that grounding URL supports.
        * Written in the target output language: **{language}**.

    **3. Quantity and Linkage:**
    *   **List All Verifiable Used Sources:** List ***every distinct***, verifiable Vertex AI grounding URL provided for this specific query that directly supports content presented in the report body via an inline citation [SSX]. Do *not* include provided grounding URLs if they were not ultimately used to support any statement in the report.
    *   **Accuracy Over Quantity:** Accuracy and adherence to the grounding rules are absolute. If fewer verifiable URLs are available *and used* from the provided results after exhaustive search, list only those used.
    *   **Fact Linkage:** Every grounding URL listed MUST directly correspond to facts/figures/statements present in the report body referenced with the corresponding inline citation [SSX].

    **4. Content Selection Based on Verifiable Grounding:**
    *   **Prerequisite for Inclusion:** Only include facts, figures, details, or quotes in the main report if they can be supported by a verifiable Vertex AI grounding URL from this query `[SSX]` or are present in a provided document `[DOCX, reference]` after exhaustive search.
    *   **Omission of Ungrounded Facts/Sections:** If specific information cannot be supported by a verifiable grounding URL or found in provided documents after exhaustive search, silently omit that detail. If a whole section cannot be grounded/documented after exhaustive search, retain the section heading but omit the content.

    **5. Final Check:**
    *   Before concluding the response, review the entire output. Verify:
        * Exclusive use of valid, provided Vertex AI grounding URLs that support cited facts `[SSX]`.
        * Correct use of `[DOCX, reference]` for documented facts.
        * Each source in this list is on a new line and follows the correct format.
        * Every fact in the report body is supported by an appropriate inline citation (`[SSX]` or `[DOCX]`) that corresponds to a source in this list or a provided document.
        * Every source listed corresponds to at least one inline citation [SSX] in the report body.
    *   The "**Sources**" section must appear only once, at the end of the entire response.

HANDLING_MISSING_INFO_INSTRUCTION = textwrap.dedent("""\
    *   **Handling Missing or Ungrounded Information:**
        *   **Exhaustive Research First:** Conduct exhaustive research using primarily official company sources (see `RESEARCH_DEPTH_INSTRUCTION`). Search diligently across *multiple relevant primary sources* (e.g., latest AR, previous AR, Financial Statements + Footnotes, Supplementary Data Packs, Tanshin/Filings, MTP docs, IR presentations, Results Overviews, specific website sections, **checking alternate language versions of the website**) for *each data point* before concluding information is unavailable. Check document publication dates for recency.
        *   **Grounding Requirement for Inclusion:** Information is included only if:
            1. The information is located in a reliable source document (either provided or found via web search).
            2. For web-found information, a corresponding, verifiable Vertex AI grounding URL (matching the pattern `https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/...`) is provided in the search results for this query.
            3. For provided document information, it is clearly present within the document.
        *   **Strict Silent Omission Policy:** If information cannot meet these conditions *after exhaustive research*, omit that specific fact, sentence, or data point entirely. Do **not** include statements like 'Data not found' or 'Information unavailable'. If an entire subsection lacks verifiable grounded/documented data, retain the heading but omit the content. If a table cell requires a placeholder for structure, use only `-` without explanation (verify data is missing *in the source*).
        *   **No Inference/Fabrication:** Do not infer, guess, or estimate ungrounded information. Do not fabricate grounding URLs.
        *   **Cross-Language Search:** If necessary, check other language results; if found, translate only the necessary information and cite the corresponding grounding URL `[SSX]` or document reference `[DOCX, reference]`.
    """)

RESEARCH_DEPTH_INSTRUCTION = textwrap.dedent("""\
    *   **Research Depth & Source Prioritization:**
        *   **Exhaustive Search & Recency:** Conduct thorough research for all requested information points. Dig beyond surface-level summaries. **MANDATORY: Prioritize and use the absolute *latest* available official sources.** Check document/website publication dates. Critically, cross-verify information across *multiple relevant primary sources* before accepting it.
        *   **Multi-Document Search Strategy:** For each key data point (e.g., specific financials, KPIs, management names, strategic initiatives), search across *different types* of official documents (e.g., Annual Report, Financial Statements + Footnotes, Supplementary Data/Databooks, Official Filings like Tanshin/EDINET/SEC, Investor Relations Presentations, Mid-Term Plans, Strategy Day materials, Earnings Call Transcripts & Presentations, official Corporate Website sections, specific Policy documents, official Press Releases).
        *   **Primary Source Focus (MANDATORY):** Use official company sources primarily, including:
            *   Latest Annual / Integrated Reports (and previous years *only* for trends/baselines)
            *   Official Financial Statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) & **Crucially: Footnotes**
            *   Supplementary Financial Data, Investor Databooks, Official Filings (e.g., **Japanese Annual Security Reports / 有価証券報告書 (Yuho)**, Tanshin, EDINET, **SEC Form 20-F/10-K**, local equivalents) - **prioritize these definitive annual filings.**
            *   Investor Relations Presentations & Materials (including Mid-Term Plans, Strategy Day presentations)
            *   Earnings Call Transcripts & Presentations (focus on Q&A sections)
            *   Official Corporate Website sections (e.g., "About Us", "Investor Relations", "Strategy", "Governance", "Sustainability/ESG", "Management/Directors") - check for "last updated" dates.
            *   Official Press Releases detailing strategy, financials, organizational structure, or significant events.
        *   # NEW: Specific Annual Report Prioritization
            **CRITICAL: Prioritize full, official annual financial reports (e.g., Annual Security Report/有価証券報告書, Form 20-F/10-K, audited consolidated Financial Statements) over summary reports, preliminary results, or quarterly/half-year interim reports.** Only use interim reports if they are the *sole* source for essential recent data *and* acknowledge this limitation internally. Always seek the comprehensive year-end filing for the period requested.
        *   # NEW: Complex Website Navigation Awareness
            **Be aware that consumer-facing websites (e.g., `brand.com`) are often distinct from the Corporate / Investor Relations site (e.g., `brand-global.com/corp/`, `brand.com/ir/`). Navigate diligently:**
            *   Look for "Investor Relations (IR)", "Shareholders & Investors", "Company Information", or "Corporate" links, often in the site footer or main navigation.
            *   Within IR sections, common paths are: IR Home -> IR Library / Financial Information / Filings -> Annual Reports / SEC Filings / Financial Results / Security Reports (有価証券報告書).
            *   Search specifically for the document types mentioned above covering the required fiscal year (e.g., "FY2023 ended March 31, 2024").
        *   # NEW: Language/Regional Site Variation Handling
            **Check both Japanese and English versions of the corporate/IR website if necessary.** Content availability (especially specific report types like Security Reports vs. Financial Results summaries) and site structure can differ. If a key document is missing on one language site, check the other before concluding it's unavailable. Prioritize the most comprehensive/official version found.
        *   **Forbidden Sources:** Do NOT use:
            *   Wikipedia
            *   Generic blogs, forums, or social media posts
            *   Press release aggregation sites (unless linking directly to an official release)
            *   Outdated market reports (unless historical context is explicitly requested)
            *   Competitor websites/reports (except in competitive analysis with extreme caution and strict grounding rules)
            *   Generic news articles unless they report specific, verifiable events from highly reputable sources (e.g., Nikkei, Bloomberg, Reuters, FT, WSJ) AND can be **cross-verified against primary sources** and have grounding URLs.
        *   **Data Verification:** Cross-verify critical figures (e.g., revenue, profit, key KPIs, management names/titles) between sources where possible (e.g., AR summary vs. detailed financials vs. website).
        *   **Group Structure Handling:** Clearly identify if data refers to the consolidated parent group (**{company_name}**) or a specific target subsidiary mentioned *in the source*. If the prompt focuses on the parent, report consolidated data unless segment data is explicitly requested and available. If focusing on a subsidiary mentioned in the source, clearly label it. Actively search for subsidiary-specific sections, appendices, or footnotes within parent company reports. Acknowledge (internally for decision-making) potential data limitations for non-publicly listed subsidiaries. **Do not report on subsidiaries unless directly relevant to the parent's structure or segment reporting as per the source [SSX].**
        *   **Noting Charts/Figures:** If relevant visual information (org charts, strategy frameworks, process diagrams) is found in sources, note its existence and location (e.g., "An organizational chart is provided on page X of the 2023 Annual Report [SSX]"). Do not attempt to recreate complex visuals textually.
        *   **Management Commentary:** Actively incorporate direct management commentary and analysis from these sources to explain trends and rationale.
        *   **Recency:** Focus on the most recent 1-2 years for qualitative analysis; use the last 3 full fiscal years for financial trends. Clearly state the reporting period for all data.
        *   **Secondary Sources:** Use reputable secondary sources sparingly *only* for context (e.g., credit ratings, widely accepted industry trends) or verification, always with clear attribution **and cross-reference with primary sources and grounding URLs.**
        *   **Handling Conflicts:** If conflicting information is found between official sources, prioritize the most recent, definitive source. Note discrepancies with dual citations if significant (e.g., [SSX, SSY]).
        *   **Calculation Guidelines:** If metrics are not explicitly reported but must be calculated:
            *   Calculate only if all necessary base data (e.g., Net Income, Revenue, Equity, Assets, Debt) is available and verifiable from grounded sources.
            *   Clearly state the formula used, and if averages are used, mention that (e.g., "ROE (Calculated: Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity)") [SSX]. **Cite the sources for all base data points used in the calculation.**
        *   **Confirmation of Unavailability (Internal):** Only conclude information is unavailable *internally* after a diligent, confirmed search across *multiple* relevant primary source *types* (including different website sections and language versions) fails to yield verifiable, grounded data. **Do not state this conclusion in the output.**

ANALYSIS_SYNTHESIS_INSTRUCTION = textwrap.dedent("""\
    *   **Analysis and Synthesis:**
        *   Beyond listing factual information, provide concise analysis where requested (e.g., explain trends, discuss implications, identify drivers, assess effectiveness).
        *   **Explicitly address "why":** For every data point or trend, explain *why* it is occurring or what the key drivers are, based on sourced information or management commentary [SSX]. Quantify trends (e.g., "Revenue increased by 12% YoY [SSX] due to...").
        *   **Comparative Analysis:** Compare data points (e.g., YoY changes, company performance against MTP targets or baseline values, segment performance differences) where appropriate and insightful, using sourced data [SSX]. Compare against industry benchmarks *only* if reliable, grounded benchmark data is available [SSY].
        *   **Linking Information:** In the General Discussion, explicitly tie together findings from different sections to present a coherent overall analysis (e.g., link financial performance [SSX] with strategic initiatives [SSY] and competitive pressures [SSZ]).
        *   **Causal Linkage:** Look for and report management commentary that explains causal relationships (e.g., "Management stated the increase in SG&A was driven by investment in X [SSX]").
        *   **DX Implications:** In summary/discussion sections, actively consider and mention potential Digital Transformation (DX) implications, opportunities, or challenges arising from the findings in other sections, citing the relevant data (e.g., "The stated need for supply chain efficiency [SSX] presents a clear opportunity for DX solutions like...")

Use the format `[SSX]` for information derived from **verifiable web grounding URLs** provided by Vertex AI Search, where X corresponds exactly to the sequential number of the source in the final Sources list. Use the format `[DOCX, reference]` for information derived directly from **provided documents**, where X is the document number and 'reference' is the page/slide/section.
        *   Place the inline citation immediately after the supported statement and **before punctuation** when possible (e.g., "Revenue was ¥100B [SS1].", "The plan outlines three pillars [DOC1, p.5].").
        *   If a single sentence contains multiple distinct facts from different sources, cite each appropriately (e.g., "Revenue was ¥100B [SS1] and the internal target is ¥110B [DOC2, Slide 10].").
        *   If a single source (web or document) supports multiple facts within a paragraph or table, reuse the same citation.

    Output Format & Quality Requirements:

    *   **Direct Start & No Conversational Text:** Begin the response directly with the first requested section heading (e.g., `## 1. Core Corporate Information`). No introductory or concluding remarks are allowed.

    *   **Strict Markdown Formatting Requirements:**
        *   Use valid and consistent Markdown throughout the entire document.
        *   **Section Formatting:** Sections MUST be numbered exactly as specified in the prompt (e.g., `## 1. Core Corporate Information`). Use `##` for main sections.
        *   **Subsection Formatting:** Use `###` for subsections and maintain hierarchical structure.
        *   **List Formatting:** Use asterisks (`*`) or hyphens (`-`) for bullets with consistent indentation (use 4 spaces for sub-bullets relative to the parent bullet).
        *   **Tables (CRITICAL FOR RENDERING):** Format all tables with *perfect* Markdown table syntax. Pay meticulous attention to:
            *   **Exact Column Count:** Every single row (header, separator, data) **MUST** have the *exact same number of columns* delimited by pipes (`|`).
            *   **Mandatory Start/End Pipes:** Every single row **MUST** begin with a pipe (`|`) and end with a pipe (`|`).
            *   **Header Separator Match:** The separator line (`|---|---|...`) **MUST** match the number of header columns exactly.
            *   **Alignment (Visual Aid):** While not strictly required by all parsers, using spaces within cells to visually align pipes in the raw Markdown source significantly helps prevent errors.
            *   **Table Data Integrity:** Every data point within a table cell MUST be verified against the cited source [SSX] for accuracy and correct reporting period.
            *   **Missing Data Placeholder:** If data for a specific cell is missing *in the source* after exhaustive search, use only a hyphen (`-`) as a placeholder if required for table structure. Do not add explanatory text.
            *   **Example of Perfect Table (Re-emphasized):**
                | Header 1        | Header 2      | Header 3          | Source(s) | <--- Ends with pipe
                |-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------| <--- Matches 4 columns, ends with pipe
                | Data Item 1     | 123.45        | Long text content | [SS1]     | <--- Matches 4 columns, ends with pipe
                | Another Item    | -             | More text here    | [SS2]     | <--- Matches 4 columns, ends with pipe
                | Final Item Data | 5,000 (JPY M) | Short text        | [SS1, SS3]| <--- Matches 4 columns, ends with pipe
            *   **Consequence of Error:** Even a single missing pipe or mismatched column count will likely cause the table to render incorrectly or not at all. Double-check every table before output.
        *   **Code Blocks:** Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks.
        *   **Quotes:** Use Markdown quote syntax (`>`) for direct quotations.

    *   **Optimal Structure & Readability:**
        *   Present numerical data in tables with proper alignment and headers. Right-align numbers where possible using spaces.
        *   Use bullet points for lists of items or characteristics.
        *   Use paragraphs for narrative descriptions and analysis.
        *   Maintain consistent formatting across similar elements.
        *   **Content Organization:** Ensure a logical sequence within each section (e.g., chronological for trends, priority for lists).
        *   **Conciseness:** Provide detailed yet concise language—be specific without unnecessary verbosity.
        *   **Quantitative Summaries:** Where summary paragraphs are requested (e.g., end of Basic Info, General Discussions), integrate key figures and quantitative trends from the analysis, not just qualitative descriptions.

    *   **Data Formatting Consistency:**
        *   Use appropriate thousands separators for numbers per the target language: **{language}**.
        *   **Currency Specification:** Always specify the currency (e.g., ¥, $, €, JPY, USD, EUR) for all monetary values along with the reporting period (e.g., "¥1,234 million for FY2023").
        *   Format dates consistently (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD or as commonly used in the target language for official reports).
        *   Use consistent percentage formatting (e.g., 12.5%).

    *   **Section Completion Verification:**
        *   Every section requested in the prompt MUST be included in the output.
        *   Sections must appear in the exact order specified.
        *   Each section must be properly labeled with the exact heading.
        *   If verifiable data for an entire subsection is missing after exhaustive research, omit the *content* of that subsection, but **retain the subsection heading** (e.g., `### Subsection Title`) to maintain the document's structure as requested by the prompt. Do not state that data is missing.

    *   **Tone and Detail Level:**
        *   Maintain a professional, objective, and analytical tone suited for a Japanese corporate strategy audience.
        *   Provide granular detail (e.g., figures, dates, metrics) while avoiding promotional language.

    *   **Completeness and Verification:**
        *   Address all requested points in each section by providing the information or silently omitting it if ungrounded after exhaustive search.
        *   Verify that every section, the General Discussion, and the Sources list are present and adhere to the instructions.
        *   Perform a final internal review before output.

    *   **Sources List:** The Sources list must be present at the very end and adhere strictly to the instructions (see `FINAL_SOURCE_LIST_INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE`). Format: `* [Supervity Source X](URL) - Annotation [SSX].`

    **Research & Grounding Strategy for Competitive Analysis:**

    1.  **Prioritize {company_name}'s Official Statements:** Use {company_name}'s own reports (Annual Report, IR materials) exhaustively to identify competitors *they* acknowledge [SSX] and their assessment of the market [SSY].
    2.  **Industry & Competitor Data Grounding:** For specific facts about the industry or competitors (e.g., market size/share, trends, competitor financials/products/strategies), use reliable third-party sources (reputable market research firms, financial news like Nikkei/Bloomberg, competitor's official reports) **only if** grounding URLs for these sources are provided by Vertex AI Search. Cite these using [SSY], [SSZ]. If no grounding URL is provided for an industry or competitor fact after exhaustive search, silently omit that specific data point. Do not invent facts or state unavailability. Ensure competitor data pertains to entities genuinely competing with {context_str}.
    3.  **Synthesis & Attribution:** When synthesizing competitive positioning or SWOT for {company_name}, clearly attribute claims. If based on {company_name}'s statements, use [SSX]. If based on grounded third-party data about the industry or a competitor, use [SSY], [SSZ]. Avoid unsourced analysis.
    4.  **Silent Omission Rule:** Silently omit any industry or competitor claim that cannot be traced back to either {company_name}'s statements [SSX] or a grounded third-party source [SSY, SSZ] after exhaustive search.
    5.  **Final Source List Integrity:** The final "Sources" list MUST include only the Vertex AI grounding URLs provided for this query (which may include links to {company_name}'s site or grounded third-party sites). Inline citations [SSX, SSY, SSZ] must match these sources.
